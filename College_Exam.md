# Ordered study list - follow this sequence - Completed

1. Types of data: qualitative vs quantitative; nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio; discrete vs continuous
2. Population vs sample; sampling frame; statistic vs parameter
3. Descriptive vs inferential statistics; variability, frequency, cumulative frequency
4. Summary statistics: mean, median, mode; variance, standard deviation
5. Other central tendency measures: geometric mean, harmonic mean, trimmed mean
6. Moving average (time-series smoothing)
7. Visualisations: stem-and-leaf, histogram, dotplot, bar chart, boxplot, QQ-plot
8. Information theory basics (Shannon entropy)
9. Sampling design basics: scheme/plan, sampling error vs bias, with/without replacement
10. Probability sampling methods - fundamentals:

    * Simple random sampling (SRS)
    * Stratified sampling (proportionate & disproportionate allocation)
    * Systematic sampling
    * Cluster sampling
    * PPS (probability proportional to size) sampling
    * Multistage sampling
    * Multiphase sampling
11. Non-probability sampling methods:

    * Purposive (judgemental) sampling
    * Convenience sampling
    * Quota sampling
    * Area (judgement) sampling
    * Snowball sampling
12. Survey & data collection systems; survey instruments
13. Questionnaire design: steps, open vs closed questions, wording, sequencing, piloting
14. Sampling distribution concepts
15. Law of Large Numbers (LLN): concept and sample-mean convergence
16. Central Limit Theorem (CLT): conditions, role of sample size, normal approximation of sample mean
17. Study types and experimental design: experimental vs observational; randomized trials, crossover, replication, local control; cohort, case-control, cross-sectional
18. Hypothesis testing basics: H0/H1, test statistic, p-value, significance level, conclusion
19. Practical data workflow: cleaning, handling missing values, summary stats, reproducible code/notebook
20. Applied analysis (IPO dataset assignment):

    * Choose field: Listing Gain / Current Gains / Total
    * Produce: histograms, dotplots, QQ-plots, time-series plot with moving average, stem-and-leaf if useful
    * Simulate repeated samples for n = 5, 30, 100; plot sample-mean histograms to demonstrate CLT
    * Plot sample mean vs sample size to demonstrate LLN
    * Compute mean, median, mode, geometric mean, harmonic mean, trimmed mean, moving average
    * Document methods, seed, sample sizes, and include labeled graphs and conclusions in a PDF report
